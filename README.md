SICP-Practise
=============
This practice contains 2 parts.

- Part 1: Write Tiny-SCM, a very very very basic Scheme interpreter. 
  I follow the tutorial from:
  [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)

- Part 2: Use Tiny-SCM to write SICP evercises.
